    <h1>5 Concepts Analyzed from <em>Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science</em></h1>

    <h3>Externality</h3>
    <p> Externalities are the consequences affecting a third party without being reflected in the initial costs of the good or service.
        An example of this is cement factories in New York causing mercury pollution and causing 1 in 6 women of childbearing age to have high enough levels of mercury in their system to harm the development of their child. </p>

    <h3>Human Capital and Profit</h3>
    <p>Human capital is the intangible economic value of a worker. This value includes skills like leadership and resourcefulness, education, knowledge, and more. An increase in human capital leads to an increase in productivity, which (in simplest terms) is the efficiency in which we make things. This increase in productivity causes an eventual increase in profit</p>

    <h3>Diversification</h3>
    <p>Diversification is the concept of spreading out all your investments across multiple assets. For example, if you had $100,000, you could spend it all on 5 or 6 stocks. However, upcoming economic and political events as well as the performance of those companies can cause their stock prices to plummet resulting in you losing a lot of your money. However, if you invest that $100,000 across 40 stocks, you reduce the risk of losing money because you're broadening your investments across the market and the market generally icnreases over time; so you're more likely to have positive returns rather than negative ones.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of Money</h3>
    <p>Today's money has several characteristics and parameters that it needs to fit into to be so widely accepted and used. We shall explore these characterisitcs in a more unconventional way: by comparing today's money with cows. The first function of today's money is to be a good means of exchange. To explain, imagine going to the grocery store and trying to pay with cash. The government actually backs your right to pay with cash, the cashier is legally obligated to allow you to pay with cash. If you wanted to pay with cows on the other hand (which aren't backed by the government), the cashier is not going to accept (for obvious reasons).
        The second characteristic is about being a good unit of account. Imagine if you're trying to buy a computer and a computer from Best Buy cost lets say 10 cows while the same computer from Walmart costs 18 chickens. How would you know which computer is cheaper? If you used money on the other hand as the sole price gauge and comparison, it would instantly become obvious which is cheaper. Then, there's a store of value. If you have a $100 bill, 30 years from now, you can still have that bill and it would for the most part be worth $100 (you'd have to consider inflation). But, if you kept a cow for 30 years, it is either sick, or more likely, dead; and so, it loses all its value. So, these characteristics are what allows money today to be so advantageous and widely used around the world and allowed such complex economic activities to have developed. Like the stock market for example. Imagine doing that with cows instead!

    <h3>Comparative Advantage Leads to Economic Growth</h3>
    <p>Comparative Advantage is to do what you do best while also giving up the least. For example, those workers in Thailand shoe factories don't necessarily make shoes better than American workers. However, by making the shoes, they allow American workers (like scientists, lawyers, and economists) to devote their time and focus on doing what they do best, which is the literal definition of specialization. Because when you specialize you are doing what you do best, you are working more efficiently than if you were doing other jobs. This increase in efficiency leads to an increase in productivity, which (as described in the second concept) leads to economic growth.</p>
