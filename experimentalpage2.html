    <h3> Sinaia </h3>
    <p> On the opposite end of the spectrum from the beach is Sinaia in the mountains. While it's a small town, its fresh air and friendly inhabitants make you feel truly free. Once you've enjoyed the wonders of the town like it's fairs and festivals, you can journey up to the mountain tops, where there are long plateaus with sheep and cows grazing. It truly is the experience of a lifetime!</p>

    <h3> Mud Volcanoes</h3>
    <p> Romania has a very intresting natural wonder called "Volcani Noroios" or Mud Volcanoes. Contrary to what you might be picturing, they are not huge structures that are driven by magmatic activity and emit lava. They are only a few feet high, and release mud and some gases. Nevertheless, they are truly mesmerizing to look at and are well worth a look on your next Romania visit!</p>
